      <description>100 WPM average for most recent races, 92 overall. Getting quicker! 100 WPM average on the recent races is with the MacBook keyboard&amp;hellip; so I guess I like this keyboard. I already loved this laptop anyway but that&amp;rsquo;s a plus!</description>

      <description>I logged back into my TypeRacer account. So here are my typing speed stats as of today. Hopefully they&amp;rsquo;ll go up, top 1% or better here I come?</description>

      <title>Tumblr is stupid</title>
      <link>https://www.jexetic.com/posts/tumblr-wtf/</link>

      <description>I was going to move my blog to Tumblr. I barely post anyway and it seemed like a decent idea. I customized a theme. Things were going alright. The theme looked good. It kinda worked.
Then I linked to my blog from the homepage. Then I realized when you click that link, Tumblr breaks the back button in your browser.
What year is this?Â Seriously!? What website is still breaking the back button in 2023?</description>

<p><em><strong>What year is this?</strong></em>Â Seriously!? What website is still breaking the back button in 2023? One thing is for certain, it wonâ€™t be my blog!</p>
<p>I assume it has something to do with them injecting advertising into the theme or in some other way caused by them trying to make money. All I know is, if you click the blog link on my website, and then click the back button, it should bring you back to my website, not trap you in a loop.</p>
<p>So yeah my blog lives here still because Tumblr is broken. Maybe I&rsquo;ll post something here more often. Unlikely though.</p>

      <title>Thoughts on HomeKit vs Alexa</title>
      <link>https://www.jexetic.com/posts/homekit/</link>

      <description>A while ago, I decided I wanted my lights to be smart. I wanted to be able to setup scenes and automations and control them through my phone or other devices. I bought an Echo Dot and some Govee lights. The Govee lights were great, the Echo and Alexa and that whole system&amp;hellip; not so much.
Even though I liked the Govee lights, my goal was to be able to use multiple brands and have them all under one sort of centralized hub.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A while ago, I decided I wanted my lights to be smart. I wanted to be able to setup scenes and automations and control them through my phone or other devices. I bought an Echo Dot and some Govee lights. The Govee lights were great, the Echo and Alexa and that whole system&hellip; not so much.</p>
<p>Even though I liked the Govee lights, my goal was to be able to use multiple brands and have them all under one sort of centralized hub. That was the purpose Alexa/Amazon was supposed to serve. Unfortunately, using Alexa is the opposite of convenient. The Echo app sort of offers a way to control your devices through the app itself, but it clearly expected you to just use Alexa voice commands instead. And, like I said, these voice commands just arenâ€™t convenient. Amazonâ€™s system just didnâ€™t really work for me.</p>
<p>Then I started eyeing HomeKit. I use a bunch of Apple devices, so having my lights connected and easily controlled through all of them seemed like it would be great. And it is. Unfortunately Govee is not HomeKit compatible, so even though I thought their products were decent I have switched to Meross bulbs and light strips. But, having everything in HomeKit makes the smart lights actually convenient and useful. I will absolutely not claim that Siri is the best virtual assistant, but she sure is great at activating my HomeKit scenes, and sheâ€™s always available through my AirPods or Apple Watch. And if I donâ€™t feel like using voice commands, home controls are easily available in control center. This is exactly what I was looking for.</p>
<p>Currently, there are definitely a lot less device options if you choose HomeKit over Google Home or Alexa. But my experience on HomeKit has been a lot more seamless than those platforms. It feels more like everything is connected and the options to control it are a lot more convenient. In the future I plan on buying a few Eve Buttons or something similar, because having actual physical controls in the real world is also convenient sometimes. These buttons arenâ€™t an option if youâ€™re using Alexa as the backend for your smart home.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Iâ€™m happy with HomeKit. This isnâ€™t an in depth review or comparison, but just a quick recap of my experience using both Alexa and HomeKit and why I like HomeKit more. Your mileage may vary, especially if you donâ€™t use many Apple devices. But honestly I have not found another alternative that works for me as seamlessly as HomeKit does, and Iâ€™ve tried both Alexa and Google Home in the past. They are very different types of systems in my opinion, and I would be happy to see other ecosystems rip off some features of HomeKit, mainly the ability to conveniently do things without yelling at a virtual assistant :)</p>

      <title>My Tech Ecosystem (November 2022)</title>
      <link>https://www.jexetic.com/posts/my-tech-ecosystem-november-2022/</link>

      <description>For the past few months Iâ€™ve been working on diversifying my tech ecosystem a bit. I have used Google for almost everything in the past but thinking about what could happen if I lost access to my Google account for whatever reason made me decide maybe it wasnâ€™t such a good idea to rely on one company for basically all my technology needs. So, hereâ€™s what Iâ€™ve been using.
Email, Contacts, and Calendar I switched from Gmail to Fastmail for all of my email addresses.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the past few months Iâ€™ve been working on diversifying my tech ecosystem a bit. I have used Google for almost everything in the past but thinking about what could happen if I lost access to my Google account for whatever reason made me decide maybe it wasnâ€™t such a good idea to rely on one company for basically all my technology needs. So, hereâ€™s what Iâ€™ve been using.</p>
<h2 id="email-contacts-and-calendar">Email, Contacts, and Calendar</h2>
<p>I switched from Gmail to Fastmail for all of my email addresses. I used to forward my custom domain emails into Gmail and then use SendGrid to send emails, but SendGridâ€™s free plan and the whole solution overall just seemed a little janky. Fastmail is $5 a month. I know for a lot of people, paying for email is a no-go. But itâ€™s nice to not rely on Google for something as important as my email (and, by extension, basically all of my online accounts). I picked Fastmail over Proton because it supports as many custom domains as I would like and just felt a little more open/neutral and has better vibes to me.</p>
<h2 id="photos-and-cloud-storage">Photos and Cloud Storage</h2>
<p>For photos and file storage, Iâ€™m sticking with Google. I setup a fresh Google account that uses my custom domain email instead of a Gmail address and started a subscription for 100GB of storage. Google Photos is too good to move away from, and Google Drive is pretty perfect as well. I plan on using Google Takeout regularly and keeping local backups for everything in addition to keeping it in the cloud. If I lose access to the account, I should still have all the data (because of regular backups) and can bring it elsewhere.</p>
<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<p>I am trying out a new notes app called UpNote and so far I love it. It seems like the perfect system for me. The organization is super flexible. The apps seem quick and lightweight. Itâ€™s available on all platforms. Plus, I purchased a lifetime license, so I should never have to worry about a subscription cost. (At the time of posting this I have been using it for quite a bit of time and have no plans of switching - it does everything I need)</p>
<h2 id="task-management">Task Management</h2>
<p>I have been heavily using Todoist each day to manage my to-do list. I have looked at Things 3 a lot but I really canâ€™t figure out a workflow in it that works for me. I rely on the app pretty heavily because I have a terrible memory. Itâ€™s a nice little productivity hub for me. Iâ€™ve tried a lot of other options besides Todoist and Things 3 as well, and I think the price of Todoist is worth it because itâ€™s the only one that feels natural to me.</p>
<h2 id="domains--hosting">Domains &amp; Hosting</h2>
<p>I settled on Porkbun for my domains. Iâ€™m using Github Pages to host this blog and I have a YOURLS instance running on Hostinger for Jexetic.me. Hostinger seems fine, I donâ€™t have much to say about it other than it hasnâ€™t given me any problems for what limited use I have for it.</p>
<h2 id="security">Security</h2>
<p>For my password manager I am using Bitwarden. Currently I use the free plan but Iâ€™ve considered using the paid plan since itâ€™s so cheap. Iâ€™m not sure that itâ€™s necessary to upgrade yet, though. For 2FA I am using Authy. I personally donâ€™t think it is a great idea to use Bitwarden for my 2FA, because it seems like that kind of defeats the whole purpose. The Authy Mac app was getting on my nerves, but I downloaded the App Store version and it seems pretty good.</p>
