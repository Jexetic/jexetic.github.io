      <description>There’s this app called Medal that I have somewhat liked for a while. Basically, it’s an app to capture and trim gaming moments with a hotkey so you can share them in Discord or whatever. I actually generally just used OBS to do the actual recording, so what Medal was good for in my scenario was trimming down those replay clips and providing an easy place to host them so I could share them into a Discord server.</description>
