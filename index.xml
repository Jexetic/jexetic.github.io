      <description>I had a terrible day at work yesterday. I‚Äôve been sick with something, idk what, but on top of that preventing me from sleeping well for several days and making me feel generally crappy and then another situation during work that really irritated me, it was just an awful day. Part of the problem, though, is I care too much. I have to get better at not caring about dumb things my manager says.</description>

I‚Äôve been sick with something, idk what, but on top of that preventing me from sleeping well for several days and making me feel generally crappy and then another situation during work that really irritated me, it was just an awful day. Part of the problem, though, is I care too much. I have to get better at not caring about dumb things my manager says. I have to enjoy my day regardless of what happens at work. Even if my manager says some stupid shit to me, I can just go to Starbucks after my shift and forget about it, and then go back to work the next day and make more money. So I‚Äôm going to try to work on that.</p>

      <description>Bitwarden has recently fired their vice president of software engineering in Jacksonville, Florida for listing his pronouns in Slack as ‚Äúassigned by God.‚Äù
Let‚Äôs talk about that for a moment. Did God, in this case, not assign you a specific gender? When people talk about you, do they not refer to you as he or her? Your religion is against a whole chunk of the English language? Having your pronouns assigned by God doesn‚Äôt even clash with listing them in Slack.</description>

Your religion is against a whole chunk of the English language? Having your pronouns assigned by God doesn‚Äôt even clash with listing them in Slack. You firmly believe you were assigned he/him by God and that shouldn‚Äôt be changed. Fine! Literally just list those assigned pronouns. I‚Äôm quite confused about what‚Äôs difficult here.</p>
<p>Has anyone ever said ‚ÄúYeah I was talking to assigned by God today and assigned by God is really having a rough time with assigned by God‚Äôs inability to do basic tasks.‚Äù Oh, they haven‚Äôt? Because your pronouns are he/him? And ‚Äúassigned by God‚Äù isn‚Äôt a pronoun? Weird.</p>
<p>If you aren&rsquo;t using a password manager, you should be, and I highly recommend Bitwarden :)</p>

      <description>I wrote a little while back about how I had chosen HomeKit as my smart home platform of choice. To be honest, I still think HomeKit is your best option out of the big three (the others being Google Home and Amazon Alexa). But I&amp;rsquo;ve made another realization: they&amp;rsquo;re all garbage.
First of all, let&amp;rsquo;s start with why I preferred HomeKit in the first place. If you try out the other two, which very much encourage you to use your voice as the primary method for operating things, you quickly realize that talking to your room to get the lights to come on is not convenient.</description>

To be honest, I still think HomeKit is your best option out of the big three (the others being Google Home and Amazon Alexa). But I&rsquo;ve made another realization: they&rsquo;re all garbage.</p>
<p>First of all, let&rsquo;s start with why I preferred HomeKit in the first place. If you try out the other two, which very much encourage you to use your voice as the primary method for operating things, you quickly realize that talking to your room to get the lights to come on is not convenient. Maybe sometimes it is. And maybe sometimes it feels really cool. But most of the time? It&rsquo;s just a pain in the ass. But I saw HomeKit as the solution to that problem. Just grab your iPhone and activate whatever scene you want or change the color of the lights, all with touch instead of yelling commands and hoping the dumb speaker understands you. And that is a much better system than the other two.</p>
<p>But then it started to randomly lose connection to my accessories. So instead of tapping a button to turn my lights on in the morning, I&rsquo;m troubleshooting HomeKit for 15 minutes instead. Which is not at all what I want. During my time using HomeKit, I&rsquo;ve had accessories stop responding several times. It might be my fault for buying cheap accessories, except you&rsquo;re basically always going to pay more for HomeKit accessories compared to other platforms, so it seems reasonable to expect even the low-end ones to work if you have to pay a premium no matter what. Unfortunately, I&rsquo;ve been having an incredibly bad week, so when HomeKit once again decided that it was going to show &ldquo;not responding&rdquo; for all my lights, I realized that this solution didn&rsquo;t feel very smart at all.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve decided to stick with cheap lights from Amazon that come with a remote. I&rsquo;m going to avoid anything that connects to my WiFi because I just want to look at pretty lights without troubleshooting my &ldquo;smart home&rdquo; platform of choice every week. I also think Govee makes some decent lights, even though those do have the ability to connect to the Internet. The nice thing about Govee lights (and probably some others) is that I can use the app and Bluetooth to configure what I want the bulb to actually do as far as color and brightness, and then turn the lamp it&rsquo;s in on and off like a normal person. It&rsquo;ll remember its settings, and it won&rsquo;t stop functioning if the internet goes down or some other connection issue happens. So yeah. That&rsquo;s all.</p>

      <title>Uber is Shady</title>

      <description>3 months ago I signed up for a trial of Uber One so I could bypass the delivery fee on my food delivery. That was my first mistake. Should‚Äôve just gone and got some food for myself. But here we are today, 3 months later. I get charged $9.99 for Uber One. Damn, that sucks, but really it‚Äôs my fault for not cancelling it before it renewed. But I should definitely go ahead and cancel it so it doesn‚Äôt charge me again next month, right?</description>

<p>The image above shows an Uber help page that states you must cancel your membership within 48 hours of it renewing. Not sooner. There‚Äôs no cancel button if you‚Äôre not within that window. ¬†I probably don‚Äôt need to point out the obvious here, but Uber is absolutely hoping you‚Äôll be uninterested in talking to their outsourced support and instead forget about it until they make another $10 from you. Come on, Uber. That‚Äôs so incredibly shady.¬†</p>
<p>Now, to the support agent‚Äôs credit, he cancelled my membership and only had to be asked a total of three times. Not too terrible! But what the fuck, Uber?</p>

      <title>Diary of a Caffeine Addict</title>

      <description>My G Fuel is coming today (you can make fun of me if you want, but I‚Äôm addicted to the caffeine). I didn‚Äôt have any yesterday and ended up with a wicked headache, so that was fun. I couldn‚Äôt start my day with caffeine today, so I‚Äôve been passing the time by editing video. I made my YouTube short that‚Äôll go up today and one to go up tomorrow. Tomorrow‚Äôs is better.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My G Fuel is coming today (you can make fun of me if you want, but I‚Äôm addicted to the caffeine). I didn‚Äôt have any yesterday and ended up with a wicked headache, so that was fun. I couldn‚Äôt start my day with caffeine today, so I‚Äôve been passing the time by editing video. I made my YouTube short that‚Äôll go up today and one to go up tomorrow. Tomorrow‚Äôs is better. Today‚Äôs is good too, it‚Äôs just only eight seconds which might be a lil too short. Hopefully, the algorithm likes them.</p>
<p>Other than editing, I sent my job the official documents they needed. I‚Äôve got another job doing a background check on me. I‚Äôm not sure if I want the new job or not. I definitely need a different job than I‚Äôve got currently because I need more money, but the one I‚Äôm being offered would be a really long bus ride, and I‚Äôm not totally vibing with that. It‚Äôs also less pay, but that hardly matters with how few hours I get at my current job. But I dunno, I just probably need to decide by Sunday.</p>
<p>Maybe I‚Äôll do some online shopping. I don‚Äôt really need to actually buy stuff until I get a better job, but I want to get more HomeKit stuff for when I move. I don‚Äôt want any non-HomeKit lights in my room. If whatever room I move into has non-standard bulbs like my current room does, I‚Äôm just getting more light strips/lamps and never turning them on lol. But I do like bright, warm light. I hate cool light, but I do need a lot of light to feel awake. But I think I could pull it off with enough light strips. But that‚Äôs only if I don‚Äôt end up in a room where they‚Äôve never heard of normal light bulbs.</p>
<p>Tomorrow my desk comes. It does not come put together. That process is likely to be irritating enough that I won‚Äôt want to record it, but I‚Äôm gonna try to take some pictures along the way so I can at least post them here. And maybe on Instagram because I‚Äôm still deciding if I wanna actually use that website or not. Or&hellip; Mastodon? maybe? I need to make a whole separate post about Mastodon at some point. I wanna like it, but it also seems kinda pointless. I also signed up for the Bluesky beta, but I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs got moderation issues and other similar issues to Twitter. Which would be totally crazy if the Twitter clone made by the old Twitter boss had Twitter issues.</p>
<p>Speaking of social media, can we talk about how fucking dumb Redditors are? Motherfuckers just make shit up. I‚Äôve seen two separate discussions this week about how we should‚Äôve known Google was gonna be evil when they took ‚Äúdon‚Äôt be evil‚Äù out of their code of conduct. Except&hellip; that‚Äôs still there. And those words never changed the fact that they have always been a capitalist company that only exists to make money, anyway. But great observation, you dumbasses.</p>
<p>Anyway, this is just something I‚Äôm trying. I think I‚Äôll try to make myself put something up on this site every day. Even if it‚Äôs just sort of a journal for myself to look back on later. Could be nice. I dunno.</p>

      <description>I was going to move my blog to Tumblr. I barely post anyway and it seemed like a decent idea. I customized a theme. Things were going alright. The theme looked good. It kinda worked.
Then I linked to my blog from the homepage. Then I realized when you click that link, Tumblr breaks the back button in your browser.
What year is this?¬†Seriously!? What website is still breaking the back button in 2023?</description>

<p><em><strong>What year is this?</strong></em>¬†Seriously!? What website is still breaking the back button in 2023? One thing is for certain, it won‚Äôt be my blog!</p>
<p>I assume it has something to do with them injecting advertising into the theme or in some other way caused by them trying to make money. All I know is, if you click the blog link on my website, and then click the back button, it should bring you back to my website, not trap you in a loop.</p>
<p>So yeah my blog lives here still because Tumblr is broken. Maybe I&rsquo;ll post something here more often. Unlikely though.</p>

      <title>Hey Google, Stop Screwing With My Metadata!</title>
      <link>https://www.jexetic.com/archived/google-photos-metadata/</link>

      <description>I like Google Photos. I‚Äôve considered other options, like Dropbox, but the thing that keeps me paying for Google One storage is how nicely Google Photos take all the photos I throw at it and organizes them for me. I don‚Äôt have to worry about manually tagging photos or making albums. If I wanna go back and look my photos later, they‚Äôre already neatly arranged for me.¬†I choose to backup everything in original quality, because of course I want to be able to go back later and get that photo or video in original resolution if I need or want it.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I like Google Photos. I‚Äôve considered other options, like Dropbox, but the thing that keeps me paying for Google One storage is how nicely Google Photos take all the photos I throw at it and organizes them for me. I don‚Äôt have to worry about manually tagging photos or making albums. If I wanna go back and look my photos later, they‚Äôre already neatly arranged for me.¬†</p>
<p>I choose to backup everything in original quality, because of course I want to be able to go back later and get that photo or video in original resolution if I need or want it. As a side-note, this is why I wasn‚Äôt really bothered when they discontinued free unlimited uploads; I want my backup in full quality anyway. I also very much like to be able to grab <em>all</em>¬†of my photos &amp; videos at once, in full quality, so I can keep them backed up and not rely solely on Google. Luckily, Google Takeout makes this really easy. Well, almost&hellip;</p>
<p>You see, Google Takeout <em>does</em>¬†export all your photos and videos in full quality for you. It even exports the metadata for you, like the creation date and location. The problem is, is exports that data¬†<em>separately!</em>¬†What?! Why is the date my photo was taken stored in some random JSON file instead of, you know, in file itself like it should be? The only obvious reason I can guess is to keep you from easily moving your entire library to another competing service. But they‚Äôre my photos. If I want to move them, I will. What the hell, Google? Why are you stripping my photos of their metadata and then giving it back to me in a different file? Why??</p>
<p>Luckily, there is a program that exists to fix this issue. Aptly named ‚ÄúGoogle Photos Metadata Fixer,‚Äù it does just that. You upload your Google Photos Takeout zip, and it combines the metadata back into the photos themselves. You know, the way Google should give it to you in the first place. I didn‚Äôt really mind paying for the program. It works great. My only worry is that eventually, Google will decide to stop giving me the metadata altogether, or make it harder to export my library in a new way. I take regular Takeout backups rather than relying solely on Google to store anything, and it‚Äôs because they do things like this that make me question whether my data is truly safe with them. It‚Äôs a shame, because I truly can‚Äôt bring myself to switch to any competitor because of how good Google Photos is otherwise.</p>

      <title>Thoughts on HomeKit vs Alexa</title>
      <link>https://www.jexetic.com/posts/homekit/</link>

      <description>A while ago, I decided I wanted my lights to be smart. I wanted to be able to setup scenes and automations and control them through my phone or other devices. I bought an Echo Dot and some Govee lights. The Govee lights were great, the Echo and Alexa and that whole system&amp;hellip; not so much.
Even though I liked the Govee lights, my goal was to be able to use multiple brands and have them all under one sort of centralized hub.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A while ago, I decided I wanted my lights to be smart. I wanted to be able to setup scenes and automations and control them through my phone or other devices. I bought an Echo Dot and some Govee lights. The Govee lights were great, the Echo and Alexa and that whole system&hellip; not so much.</p>
<p>Even though I liked the Govee lights, my goal was to be able to use multiple brands and have them all under one sort of centralized hub. That was the purpose Alexa/Amazon was supposed to serve. Unfortunately, using Alexa is the opposite of convenient. The Echo app sort of offers a way to control your devices through the app itself, but it clearly expected you to just use Alexa voice commands instead. And, like I said, these voice commands just aren‚Äôt convenient. Amazon‚Äôs system just didn‚Äôt really work for me.</p>
<p>Then I started eyeing HomeKit. I use a bunch of Apple devices, so having my lights connected and easily controlled through all of them seemed like it would be great. And it is. Unfortunately Govee is not HomeKit compatible, so even though I thought their products were decent I have switched to Meross bulbs and light strips. But, having everything in HomeKit makes the smart lights actually convenient and useful. I will absolutely not claim that Siri is the best virtual assistant, but she sure is great at activating my HomeKit scenes, and she‚Äôs always available through my AirPods or Apple Watch. And if I don‚Äôt feel like using voice commands, home controls are easily available in control center. This is exactly what I was looking for.</p>
<p>Currently, there are definitely a lot less device options if you choose HomeKit over Google Home or Alexa. But my experience on HomeKit has been a lot more seamless than those platforms. It feels more like everything is connected and the options to control it are a lot more convenient. In the future I plan on buying a few Eve Buttons or something similar, because having actual physical controls in the real world is also convenient sometimes. These buttons aren‚Äôt an option if you‚Äôre using Alexa as the backend for your smart home.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I‚Äôm happy with HomeKit. This isn‚Äôt an in depth review or comparison, but just a quick recap of my experience using both Alexa and HomeKit and why I like HomeKit more. Your mileage may vary, especially if you don‚Äôt use many Apple devices. But honestly I have not found another alternative that works for me as seamlessly as HomeKit does, and I‚Äôve tried both Alexa and Google Home in the past. They are very different types of systems in my opinion, and I would be happy to see other ecosystems rip off some features of HomeKit, mainly the ability to conveniently do things without yelling at a virtual assistant :)</p>

      <title>Tech I Like (November 2022)</title>
      <link>https://www.jexetic.com/posts/my-tech-ecosystem-november-2022/</link>

      <guid>https://www.jexetic.com/posts/my-tech-ecosystem-november-2022/</guid>
      <description>For the past few months I‚Äôve been working on diversifying my tech ecosystem a bit. I have used Google for almost everything in the past but thinking about what could happen if I lost access to my Google account for whatever reason made me decide maybe it wasn‚Äôt such a good idea to rely on one company for basically all my technology needs. So, here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been using.
Email, Contacts, and Calendar I switched from Gmail to Fastmail for all of my email addresses.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the past few months I‚Äôve been working on diversifying my tech ecosystem a bit. I have used Google for almost everything in the past but thinking about what could happen if I lost access to my Google account for whatever reason made me decide maybe it wasn‚Äôt such a good idea to rely on one company for basically all my technology needs. So, here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been using.</p>
<h2 id="email-contacts-and-calendar">Email, Contacts, and Calendar</h2>
<p>I switched from Gmail to Fastmail for all of my email addresses. I used to forward my custom domain emails into Gmail and then use SendGrid to send emails, but SendGrid‚Äôs free plan and the whole solution overall just seemed a little janky. Fastmail is $5 a month. I know for a lot of people, paying for email is a no-go. But it‚Äôs nice to not rely on Google for something as important as my email (and, by extension, basically all of my online accounts). I picked Fastmail over Proton because it supports as many custom domains as I would like and just felt a little more open/neutral and has better vibes to me.</p>
<h2 id="photos-and-cloud-storage">Photos and Cloud Storage</h2>
<p>For photos and file storage, I‚Äôm sticking with Google. I setup a fresh Google account that uses my custom domain email instead of a Gmail address and started a subscription for 100GB of storage. Google Photos is too good to move away from, and Google Drive is pretty perfect as well. I plan on using Google Takeout regularly and keeping local backups for everything in addition to keeping it in the cloud. If I lose access to the account, I should still have all the data (because of regular backups) and can bring it elsewhere.</p>
<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<p>I am trying out a new notes app called UpNote and so far I love it. It seems like the perfect system for me. The organization is super flexible. The apps seem quick and lightweight. It‚Äôs available on all platforms. Plus, I purchased a lifetime license, so I should never have to worry about a subscription cost. (At the time of posting this I have been using it for quite a bit of time and have no plans of switching - it does everything I need)</p>
<h2 id="task-management">Task Management</h2>
<p>I have been heavily using Todoist each day to manage my to-do list. I have looked at Things 3 a lot but I really can‚Äôt figure out a workflow in it that works for me. I rely on the app pretty heavily because I have a terrible memory. It‚Äôs a nice little productivity hub for me. I‚Äôve tried a lot of other options besides Todoist and Things 3 as well, and I think the price of Todoist is worth it because it‚Äôs the only one that feels natural to me.</p>
<h2 id="domains--hosting">Domains &amp; Hosting</h2>
<p>I settled on Porkbun for my domains. I‚Äôm using Github Pages to host this blog and I have a YOURLS instance running on Hostinger for Jexetic.me. Hostinger seems fine, I don‚Äôt have much to say about it other than it hasn‚Äôt given me any problems for what limited use I have for it.</p>
<h2 id="security">Security</h2>
<p>For my password manager I am using Bitwarden. Currently I use the free plan but I‚Äôve considered using the paid plan since it‚Äôs so cheap. I‚Äôm not sure that it‚Äôs necessary to upgrade yet, though. For 2FA I am using Authy. I personally don‚Äôt think it is a great idea to use Bitwarden for my 2FA, because it seems like that kind of defeats the whole purpose. The Authy Mac app was getting on my nerves, but I downloaded the App Store version and it seems pretty good.</p>

      <title>Medal is Ruined</title>

      <description>There‚Äôs this app called Medal that I have somewhat liked for a while. Basically, it‚Äôs an app to capture and trim gaming moments with a hotkey so you can share them in Discord or whatever. I actually generally just used OBS to do the actual recording, so what Medal was good for in my scenario was trimming down those replay clips and providing an easy place to host them so I could share them into a Discord server.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There‚Äôs this app called Medal that I have somewhat liked for a while. Basically, it‚Äôs an app to capture and trim gaming moments with a hotkey so you can share them in Discord or whatever. I actually generally just used OBS to do the actual recording, so what Medal was good for in my scenario was trimming down those replay clips and providing an easy place to host them so I could share them into a Discord server. Unfortunately, that functionality is essentially gone. Yes, you can still use Medal to share clips to Discord. But they‚Äôve completely disabled embeds. Let‚Äôs be real: nobody wants to open their web browser just to watch a 15-30 second gaming clip. Removing Discord embeds immediately makes the app less useful. Unfortunately, it doesn‚Äôt even end there. Medal now also wants to charge you to download the clips you‚Äôre hosting there if you don‚Äôt want them to add a watermark. This just plain sucks, to be honest. This means it‚Äôs hardly useful as a place to actually store/host clips anymore. If I‚Äôm gonna pay for somewhere to host the clips I may as well just pay for something like Streamable and get 2TB for whatever video uploads I want, and they‚Äôll actually embed to Discord. Or, you know, just throw them on YouTube for free. Which also embeds to Discord. C‚Äômon Medal, you know what we‚Äôre using your app for. You ruined it. RIP.</p>
<p>Update: They have added back the ability to embed to Discord, although it&rsquo;s now controlled by a setting which seems to be disabled by default which is just odd. You do still need to pay if you&rsquo;d like to be able to download your clips without a Medal watermark.</p>
