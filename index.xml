      <description>Below, you can read about the datapacks we have on the server. Datapacks are included in the world files (so you don&amp;rsquo;t need to download anything) and make slight changes to the vanilla game.

To set a home, type /trigger sethome set x (where x is a number 1-5). To teleport to a home, type /trigger home set x (where x is the number of the home you’d like to go to).</description>

      <description>For the past few months I’ve been working on diversifying my tech ecosystem a bit. I have used Google for almost everything in the past but thinking about what could happen if I lost access to my Google account for whatever reason made me decide maybe it wasn’t such a good idea to rely on one company for basically all my technology needs. So, here’s what I’ve been using.
Email, Contacts, and Calendar I switched from Gmail to Fastmail for all of my email addresses.</description>

      <description>There’s this app called Medal that I have somewhat liked for a while. Basically, it’s an app to capture and trim gaming moments with a hotkey so you can share them in Discord or whatever. I actually generally just used OBS to do the actual recording, so what Medal was good for in my scenario was trimming down those replay clips and providing an easy place to host them so I could share them into a Discord server.</description>

      <description>Jexetic.me is a link shortener used by Jexetic. A link beginning with Jexetic.me will never lead to a phishing, malware, or scam website.
Note: Jexetic.com and Jexetic.me are not interchangeable. Jexetic.me/discord leads to Jexetic&amp;rsquo;s Discord server, while Jexetic.com/discord leads nowhere.</description>
