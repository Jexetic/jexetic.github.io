## About
- The logs are not updated on a schedule, just whenever I have the time and feel like it.
- Deleted messages are not intentionally preserved, but if a message is deleted after a channel is archived it will show here until the next time the channel is archived.
- Private channels require an encryption key, contact me to recieve the key for a specific channel.
