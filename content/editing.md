Hi! Do you need a video edited? Have some gaming clips you want turned into a YouTube Short or TikTok? I'm the person you're looking for! I'll trim your video down to the best moments, add animated subtitles, zooms, memes, and call-to-actions, and all you'll have to do is upload it! I specialize in short-form vertical gaming videos (for TikTok/YT Shorts), but I'm open to edit plenty of other types of content as well. 

## Watch my edits
To see videos and shorts I've edited, check out my [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@Jexetic). Everything there is edited by me. You can also see a couple examples below.
