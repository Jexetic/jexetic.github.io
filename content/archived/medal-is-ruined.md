There’s this app called Medal that I have somewhat liked for a while. Basically, it’s an app to capture and trim gaming moments with a hotkey so you can share them in Discord or whatever. I actually generally just used OBS to do the actual recording, so what Medal was good for in my scenario was trimming down those replay clips and providing an easy place to host them so I could share them into a Discord server. Unfortunately, that functionality is essentially gone. Yes, you can still use Medal to share clips to Discord. But they’ve completely disabled embeds. Let’s be real: nobody wants to open their web browser just to watch a 15-30 second gaming clip. Removing Discord embeds immediately makes the app less useful. Unfortunately, it doesn’t even end there. Medal now also wants to charge you to download the clips you’re hosting there if you don’t want them to add a watermark. This just plain sucks, to be honest. This means it’s hardly useful as a place to actually store/host clips anymore. If I’m gonna pay for somewhere to host the clips I may as well just pay for something like Streamable and get 2TB for whatever video uploads I want, and they’ll actually embed to Discord. Or, you know, just throw them on YouTube for free. Which also embeds to Discord. C’mon Medal, you know what we’re using your app for. You ruined it. RIP.

Update: They have added back the ability to embed to Discord, although it's now controlled by a setting which seems to be disabled by default which is just odd. You do still need to pay if you'd like to be able to download your clips without a Medal watermark.
