Bitwarden has recently fired their vice president of software engineering in Jacksonville, Florida for listing his pronouns in Slack as “assigned by God.”

Let’s talk about that for a moment. Did God, in this case, not assign you a specific gender? When people talk about you, do they not refer to you as he or her? Your religion is against a whole chunk of the English language? Having your pronouns assigned by God doesn’t even clash with listing them in Slack. You firmly believe you were assigned he/him by God and that shouldn’t be changed. Fine! Literally just list those assigned pronouns. I’m quite confused about what’s difficult here.

Has anyone ever said “Yeah I was talking to assigned by God today and assigned by God is really having a rough time with assigned by God’s inability to do basic tasks.” Oh, they haven’t? Because your pronouns are he/him? And “assigned by God” isn’t a pronoun? Weird.

If you aren't using a password manager, you should be, and I highly recommend Bitwarden :)
