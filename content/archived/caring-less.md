I had a terrible day at work yesterday. I’ve been sick with something, idk what, but on top of that preventing me from sleeping well for several days and making me feel generally crappy and then another situation during work that really irritated me, it was just an awful day. Part of the problem, though, is I care too much. I have to get better at not caring about dumb things my manager says. I have to enjoy my day regardless of what happens at work. Even if my manager says some stupid shit to me, I can just go to Starbucks after my shift and forget about it, and then go back to work the next day and make more money. So I’m going to try to work on that.
