I like Google Photos. I’ve considered other options, like Dropbox, but the thing that keeps me paying for Google One storage is how nicely Google Photos take all the photos I throw at it and organizes them for me. I don’t have to worry about manually tagging photos or making albums. If I wanna go back and look my photos later, they’re already neatly arranged for me. 

  

I choose to backup everything in original quality, because of course I want to be able to go back later and get that photo or video in original resolution if I need or want it. As a side-note, this is why I wasn’t really bothered when they discontinued free unlimited uploads; I want my backup in full quality anyway. I also very much like to be able to grab _all_ of my photos & videos at once, in full quality, so I can keep them backed up and not rely solely on Google. Luckily, Google Takeout makes this really easy. Well, almost...

  

You see, Google Takeout _does_ export all your photos and videos in full quality for you. It even exports the metadata for you, like the creation date and location. The problem is, is exports that data _separately!_ What?! Why is the date my photo was taken stored in some random JSON file instead of, you know, in file itself like it should be? The only obvious reason I can guess is to keep you from easily moving your entire library to another competing service. But they’re my photos. If I want to move them, I will. What the hell, Google? Why are you stripping my photos of their metadata and then giving it back to me in a different file? Why??

  

Luckily, there is a program that exists to fix this issue. Aptly named “Google Photos Metadata Fixer,” it does just that. You upload your Google Photos Takeout zip, and it combines the metadata back into the photos themselves. You know, the way Google should give it to you in the first place. I didn’t really mind paying for the program. It works great. My only worry is that eventually, Google will decide to stop giving me the metadata altogether, or make it harder to export my library in a new way. I take regular Takeout backups rather than relying solely on Google to store anything, and it’s because they do things like this that make me question whether my data is truly safe with them. It’s a shame, because I truly can’t bring myself to switch to any competitor because of how good Google Photos is otherwise.
