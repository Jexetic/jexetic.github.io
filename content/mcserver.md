If you have a question about the Minecraft server, you can probably find the answer on this page.

## The Map
You can view the map in your browser at [Jexetic.me/map](https://jexetic.me/map). 

## Teleport to spawn
To teleport to spawn/our main area, type `/trigger spawn` 

## Teleport home
Each player can set up to 5 homes.

To set a home, type `/trigger sethome set x` (where `x` is a number 1-5).
To teleport to a home, type `/trigger home set x` (where `x` is the number of the home you’d like to go to).

To delete a home, type `/trigger delhome set x` (where `x` is the number of the home you’d like to delete).
To list your homes, type `/trigger homes` 

To name your homes, hold a nametag with the name you want and type `/trigger namehome set x` where x is the number of the home you’d like to name. Keep in mind that you still have to use the number and not the name in commands; this just sets a name you can see in the home list.

## Teleport to a player
To teleport to a player, first hold tab and see what the yellow number to the right of their name is. 
Then, type `/trigger tpa set x` where `x` is the number you found next to their name.

To accept a teleport request, type `/trigger tpaccept`

## Graves
To find your last death point, type `/trigger grave` 
Once you find your grave, right click it while sneaking to retrieve your items.

## Coordinates HUD
You can display your current coordinates (and some other in-game info) above your hot-bar if you’d like. Use the command `/trigger ch_toggle` to turn this display on and off.

## Add armor to elytras
Drop a chestplate and an elytra on top of an anvil together to combine them into an armored elytra.

## How to get phantom membranes
Phantoms are disabled. To get phantom membranes, kill bats instead.

## Chairs
Drop a saddle on a stair block to create a chair that you can right click to sit in.

## Path block speed effect
Use a shovel to create path blocks for a speed boost. This speed boost stacks with other sources of speed, like beacons or potions.

## Change your name color
Use `/trigger color`  to set your name color.

## Extra ender dragon drops
Every time the dragon is killed, it will drop an Elytra and a Dragon Egg.

## Position armor stands
You can use a book and quill to edit the positioning of armor stands. To learn more about this feature, [click here](https://wiki.gm4.co/wiki/Better_Armour_Stands "https://wiki.gm4.co/wiki/Better_Armour_Stands").

## Hide item frame backgrounds
Use an invisibility splash potion to turn an item frame into a display frame, which will only show the item without the frame background. 

## Holographs
Place a named nametag in an item frame to create text holograms. Place an item frame back in the same spot to retrieve the nametag and destroy the hologram. Place the item frame and nametag on any color wool to choose the color of the hologram text. The wool block can be changed to whatever else you want after creating the hologram.

## Get mob heads
There is a chance to receive a head when killing most mobs in the game.

## Get player heads
When killing a player, their head should drop outside of their grave. Enjoy.

## Get custom heads
You can obtain custom player heads for decoration using the `/head` command. Each custom head will cost you 5 diamonds.

## Timber (quickly chop trees)
By default, you will chop down entire trees at once if you use an axe without sneaking. To turn this off or back on, run the command `/trigger TimberToggle` 

## Store your XP in your ender chest
Stand on top of an ender chest to store your XP for later. Stand under the ender chest to get the XP back when you're ready to use it.

## Make an elevator
Drop an ender pearl on top of a wool block to turn it into an elevator. Jump or crouch to move between elevators of the same color that are directly above or below each other.

## Custom recipes
[Click here](https://imgur.com/a/XfVpD2h "https://imgur.com/a/XfVpD2h") to see all the custom crafting and smelting recipes enabled on the server.

## Tower structures
Towers spawn between Y=80 and Y=200 up high on hills and mountains. Some biomes have a specific dungeon variant: desert, ocean, mesa and snowy biomes. 

Spawners have a chance to be Spider, Skeleton, Creeper or Zombie. They are standard vanilla spawners with the vanilla mobs and a 16-block player range. Mobs spawned by these spawners will not drop xp or loot when killed.

Towers contain loot chests. The quality of items is determined by how high the chest is with better loot appearing in chests higher up in the tower.
