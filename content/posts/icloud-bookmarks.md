I am really not a fan of iCloud. I love my Apple devices, don’t get me wrong. But I’d rather my photos and files be stuck with Google, which has services that work great on basically whatever device you choose, than iCloud, which is obviously an Apple focused service.

  

I do, however, like Safari. I’ve found all the extensions that I need including a good [Adblocker](https://adguard.com/en/welcome.html "https://adguard.com/en/welcome.html"). I like knowing I’m using the most battery efficient browser for my Macbook. I like the [Reddit extension](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sink-it-for-reddit/id6449873635 "https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sink-it-for-reddit/id6449873635") I found for Safari on my phone. Overall, I’m happy to not use Firefox on my Apple devices.

  

I still have a Windows PC though. I use it for gaming, but I also just use it for browsing sometimes (lots of YouTube, that’s for sure). And I decided I would really like it if I could still sync bookmarks between _all_ of my devices. And what I am surprised to have found out is the simplest solution is to just use iCloud on Windows.

  

I have used iCloud on Windows before when I tried out switching from Google Photos and Drive to iCloud Photos and Drive. I did not enjoy that experience. But iCloud Bookmarks? Even though I expected any sort of iCloud solution on Windows to be a complete pain in the ass, it actually just... stays out of the way. I save my bookmarks as normal, and they sync across devices. Why does this require the entire iCloud for Windows application to be installed for the bookmarks extension to work? I’m not sure. But I will settle for that since it does actually seem to be the (near) perfect solution.

  

## Tech I’ve dropped

In other news, there’s some tech I’ve abandoned since my post in November about my favorite tech things. Instead of Todoist, I’m actually just using Apple Reminders now. I don’t really make a full to-do list anymore - some things I don’t need to be reminded to do. Plus, Siri is fine for something as simple as adding reminders, so having that available with my watch or phone is nice. I’ve also stopped paying for Hostinger, which was hosting my [Jexetic.me](https://Jexetic.me "https://Jexetic.me") shortlinks. I honestly just couldn’t justify the price. That domain just leads to this site now, and I’ve setup HTML redirects for the most important shortlinks I had. It’s less convenient than YOURLs, but it’s also free.

  

Alright, that’s the end of my technology ranting for now. If you read this far, I hope you enjoyed :)
