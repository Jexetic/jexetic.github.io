For the past few months I’ve been working on diversifying my tech ecosystem a bit. I have used Google for almost everything in the past but thinking about what could happen if I lost access to my Google account for whatever reason made me decide maybe it wasn’t such a good idea to rely on one company for basically all my technology needs. So, here’s what I’ve been using.

## Email, Contacts, and Calendar

I switched from Gmail to Fastmail for all of my email addresses. I used to forward my custom domain emails into Gmail and then use SendGrid to send emails, but SendGrid’s free plan and the whole solution overall just seemed a little janky. Fastmail is $5 a month. I know for a lot of people, paying for email is a no-go. But it’s nice to not rely on Google for something as important as my email (and, by extension, basically all of my online accounts). I picked Fastmail over Proton because it supports as many custom domains as I would like and just felt a little more open/neutral and has better vibes to me.

  

## Photos and Cloud Storage

For photos and file storage, I’m sticking with Google. I setup a fresh Google account that uses my custom domain email instead of a Gmail address and started a subscription for 100GB of storage. Google Photos is too good to move away from, and Google Drive is pretty perfect as well. I plan on using Google Takeout regularly and keeping local backups for everything in addition to keeping it in the cloud. If I lose access to the account, I should still have all the data (because of regular backups) and can bring it elsewhere.

  

## Notes

I am trying out a new notes app called UpNote and so far I love it. It seems like the perfect system for me. The organization is super flexible. The apps seem quick and lightweight. It’s available on all platforms. Plus, I purchased a lifetime license, so I should never have to worry about a subscription cost. (At the time of posting this I have been using it for quite a bit of time and have no plans of switching - it does everything I need)

  

## Task Management

I have been heavily using Todoist each day to manage my to-do list. I have looked at Things 3 a lot but I really can’t figure out a workflow in it that works for me. I rely on the app pretty heavily because I have a terrible memory. It’s a nice little productivity hub for me. I’ve tried a lot of other options besides Todoist and Things 3 as well, and I think the price of Todoist is worth it because it’s the only one that feels natural to me.

  

## Domains & Hosting

I settled on Porkbun for my domains. I’m using Github Pages to host this blog and I have a YOURLS instance running on Hostinger for Jexetic.me. Hostinger seems fine, I don’t have much to say about it other than it hasn’t given me any problems for what limited use I have for it.

  

## Security

For my password manager I am using Bitwarden. Currently I use the free plan but I’ve considered using the paid plan since it’s so cheap. I’m not sure that it’s necessary to upgrade yet, though. For 2FA I am using Authy. I personally don’t think it is a great idea to use Bitwarden for my 2FA, because it seems like that kind of defeats the whole purpose. The Authy Mac app was getting on my nerves, but I downloaded the App Store version and it seems pretty good.
