I can't explain why, but I am currently hopelessly addicted to Tyler Oakley and Korey Kuhl's podcast [Psychobabble](https://pod.link/914634944). I'm not going to pretend I know who Korey Kuhl is outside of this podcast, and I watched some of Tyler Oakley's YouTube videos but wasn't a superfan or anything. But I've been binging episodes of this podcast basically every day. I listen while I walk to work and it's been the only show I've been listening to. 

So yeah. Check it out. Or don't.
