A while ago, I decided I wanted my lights to be smart. I wanted to be able to setup scenes and automations and control them through my phone or other devices. I bought an Echo Dot and some Govee lights. The Govee lights were great, the Echo and Alexa and that whole system... not so much.

Even though I liked the Govee lights, my goal was to be able to use multiple brands and have them all under one sort of centralized hub. That was the purpose Alexa/Amazon was supposed to serve. Unfortunately, using Alexa is the opposite of convenient. The Echo app sort of offers a way to control your devices through the app itself, but it clearly expected you to just use Alexa voice commands instead. And, like I said, these voice commands just aren’t convenient. Amazon’s system just didn’t really work for me.

Then I started eyeing HomeKit. I use a bunch of Apple devices, so having my lights connected and easily controlled through all of them seemed like it would be great. And it is. Unfortunately Govee is not HomeKit compatible, so even though I thought their products were decent I have switched to Meross bulbs and light strips. But, having everything in HomeKit makes the smart lights actually convenient and useful. I will absolutely not claim that Siri is the best virtual assistant, but she sure is great at activating my HomeKit scenes, and she’s always available through my AirPods or Apple Watch. And if I don’t feel like using voice commands, home controls are easily available in control center. This is exactly what I was looking for.

Currently, there are definitely a lot less device options if you choose HomeKit over Google Home or Alexa. But my experience on HomeKit has been a lot more seamless than those platforms. It feels more like everything is connected and the options to control it are a lot more convenient. In the future I plan on buying a few Eve Buttons or something similar, because having actual physical controls in the real world is also convenient sometimes. These buttons aren’t an option if you’re using Alexa as the backend for your smart home. 

In conclusion, I’m happy with HomeKit. This isn’t an in depth review or comparison, but just a quick recap of my experience using both Alexa and HomeKit and why I like HomeKit more. Your mileage may vary, especially if you don’t use many Apple devices. But honestly I have not found another alternative that works for me as seamlessly as HomeKit does, and I’ve tried both Alexa and Google Home in the past. They are very different types of systems in my opinion, and I would be happy to see other ecosystems rip off some features of HomeKit, mainly the ability to conveniently do things without yelling at a virtual assistant :)
