I was going to move my blog to Tumblr. I barely post anyway and it seemed like a decent idea. I customized a theme. Things were going alright. The theme looked good. It kinda worked.
  
Then I linked to my blog from the homepage. Then I realized when you click that link, Tumblr breaks the back button in your browser.
  
_**What year is this?**_ Seriously!? What website is still breaking the back button in 2023? One thing is for certain, it won’t be my blog!
  
I assume it has something to do with them injecting advertising into the theme or in some other way caused by them trying to make money. All I know is, if you click the blog link on my website, and then click the back button, it should bring you back to my website, not trap you in a loop.
  
So yeah my blog lives here still because Tumblr is broken. Maybe I'll post something here more often. Unlikely though.
