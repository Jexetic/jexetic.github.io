I wrote a little while back about how I had chosen HomeKit as my smart home platform of choice. To be honest, I still think HomeKit is your best option out of the big three (the others being Google Home and Amazon Alexa). But I've made another realization: they're all garbage.

First of all, let's start with why I preferred HomeKit in the first place. If you try out the other two, which very much encourage you to use your voice as the primary method for operating things, you quickly realize that talking to your room to get the lights to come on is not convenient. Maybe sometimes it is. And maybe sometimes it feels really cool. But most of the time? It's just a pain in the ass. But I saw HomeKit as the solution to that problem. Just grab your iPhone and activate whatever scene you want or change the color of the lights, all with touch instead of yelling commands and hoping the dumb speaker understands you. And that is a much better system than the other two.

But then it started to randomly lose connection to my accessories. So instead of tapping a button to turn my lights on in the morning, I'm troubleshooting HomeKit for 15 minutes instead. Which is not at all what I want. During my time using HomeKit, I've had accessories stop responding several times. It might be my fault for buying cheap accessories, except you're basically always going to pay more for HomeKit accessories compared to other platforms, so it seems reasonable to expect even the low-end ones to work if you have to pay a premium no matter what. Unfortunately, I've been having an incredibly bad week, so when HomeKit once again decided that it was going to show "not responding" for all my lights, I realized that this solution didn't feel very smart at all.

I've decided to stick with cheap lights from Amazon that come with a remote. I'm going to avoid anything that connects to my WiFi because I just want to look at pretty lights without troubleshooting my "smart home" platform of choice every week. I also think Govee makes some decent lights, even though those do have the ability to connect to the Internet. The nice thing about Govee lights (and probably some others) is that I can use the app and Bluetooth to configure what I want the bulb to actually do as far as color and brightness, and then turn the lamp it's in on and off like a normal person. It'll remember its settings, and it won't stop functioning if the internet goes down or some other connection issue happens. So yeah. That's all.
