      <description>There’s this app called Medal that I have somewhat liked for a while. Basically, it’s an app to capture and trim gaming moments with a hotkey so you can share them in Discord or whatever. I actually generally just used OBS to do the actual recording, so what Medal was good for in my scenario was trimming down those replay clips and providing an easy place to host them so I could share them into a Discord server.</description>

      <description>It’s become super clear to me that the biggest trigger for my anxiety is anticipation. When it comes to work, I’m most anxious in the hour leading up to the start of my shift, and then once I clock in and start working the anxiety level plummets. If I have an appointment, I can’t relax until after the appointment is over. All I can focus on until then is making sure I make it to the appointment on time and with everything I need.</description>
