      <description>I can&amp;rsquo;t explain why, but I am currently hopelessly addicted to Tyler Oakley and Korey Kuhl&amp;rsquo;s podcast Psychobabble. I&amp;rsquo;m not going to pretend I know who Korey Kuhl is outside of this podcast, and I watched some of Tyler Oakley&amp;rsquo;s YouTube videos but wasn&amp;rsquo;t a superfan or anything. But I&amp;rsquo;ve been binging episodes of this podcast basically every day. I listen while I walk to work and it&amp;rsquo;s been the only show I&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to.</description>

      <description>I wrote a little while back about how I had chosen HomeKit as my smart home platform of choice. To be honest, I still think HomeKit is your best option out of the big three (the others being Google Home and Amazon Alexa). But I&amp;rsquo;ve made another realization: they&amp;rsquo;re all garbage.
First of all, let&amp;rsquo;s start with why I preferred HomeKit in the first place. If you try out the other two, which very much encourage you to use your voice as the primary method for operating things, you quickly realize that talking to your room to get the lights to come on is not convenient.</description>

To be honest, I still think HomeKit is your best option out of the big three (the others being Google Home and Amazon Alexa). But I&rsquo;ve made another realization: they&rsquo;re all garbage.</p>
<p>First of all, let&rsquo;s start with why I preferred HomeKit in the first place. If you try out the other two, which very much encourage you to use your voice as the primary method for operating things, you quickly realize that talking to your room to get the lights to come on is not convenient. Maybe sometimes it is. And maybe sometimes it feels really cool. But most of the time? It&rsquo;s just a pain in the ass. But I saw HomeKit as the solution to that problem. Just grab your iPhone and activate whatever scene you want or change the color of the lights, all with touch instead of yelling commands and hoping the dumb speaker understands you. And that is a much better system than the other two.</p>
<p>But then it started to randomly lose connection to my accessories. So instead of tapping a button to turn my lights on in the morning, I&rsquo;m troubleshooting HomeKit for 15 minutes instead. Which is not at all what I want. During my time using HomeKit, I&rsquo;ve had accessories stop responding several times. It might be my fault for buying cheap accessories, except you&rsquo;re basically always going to pay more for HomeKit accessories compared to other platforms, so it seems reasonable to expect even the low-end ones to work if you have to pay a premium no matter what. Unfortunately, I&rsquo;ve been having an incredibly bad week, so when HomeKit once again decided that it was going to show &ldquo;not responding&rdquo; for all my lights, I realized that this solution didn&rsquo;t feel very smart at all.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve decided to stick with cheap lights from Amazon that come with a remote. I&rsquo;m going to avoid anything that connects to my WiFi because I just want to look at pretty lights without troubleshooting my &ldquo;smart home&rdquo; platform of choice every week. I also think Govee makes some decent lights, even though those do have the ability to connect to the Internet. The nice thing about Govee lights (and probably some others) is that I can use the app and Bluetooth to configure what I want the bulb to actually do as far as color and brightness, and then turn the lamp it&rsquo;s in on and off like a normal person. It&rsquo;ll remember its settings, and it won&rsquo;t stop functioning if the internet goes down or some other connection issue happens. So yeah. That&rsquo;s all.</p>

      <title>Uber is Shady</title>
      <link>https://www.jexetic.com/posts/uber-is-scummy/</link>

      <description>3 months ago I signed up for a trial of Uber One so I could bypass the delivery fee on my food delivery. That was my first mistake. Should’ve just gone and got some food for myself. But here we are today, 3 months later. I get charged $9.99 for Uber One. Damn, that sucks, but really it’s my fault for not cancelling it before it renewed. But I should definitely go ahead and cancel it so it doesn’t charge me again next month, right?</description>

<p><a href="img1.png"><img loading="lazy" src="img1.png" alt="Uber Screenshot"  title="uber screenshot"  />
</a></p>
<p>The image above shows an Uber help page that states you must cancel your membership within 48 hours of it renewing. Not sooner. There’s no cancel button if you’re not within that window.  I probably don’t need to point out the obvious here, but Uber is absolutely hoping you’ll be uninterested in talking to their outsourced support and instead forget about it until they make another $10 from you. Come on, Uber. That’s so incredibly shady. </p>
<p>Now, to the support agent’s credit, he cancelled my membership and only had to be asked a total of three times. Not too terrible! But what the fuck, Uber?</p>

      <title>Diary of a Caffeine Addict</title>

      <description>My G Fuel is coming today (you can make fun of me if you want, but I’m addicted to the caffeine). I didn’t have any yesterday and ended up with a wicked headache, so that was fun. I couldn’t start my day with caffeine today, so I’ve been passing the time by editing video. I made my YouTube short that’ll go up today and one to go up tomorrow. Tomorrow’s is better.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My G Fuel is coming today (you can make fun of me if you want, but I’m addicted to the caffeine). I didn’t have any yesterday and ended up with a wicked headache, so that was fun. I couldn’t start my day with caffeine today, so I’ve been passing the time by editing video. I made my YouTube short that’ll go up today and one to go up tomorrow. Tomorrow’s is better. Today’s is good too, it’s just only eight seconds which might be a lil too short. Hopefully, the algorithm likes them.</p>
<p>Other than editing, I sent my job the official documents they needed. I’ve got another job doing a background check on me. I’m not sure if I want the new job or not. I definitely need a different job than I’ve got currently because I need more money, but the one I’m being offered would be a really long bus ride, and I’m not totally vibing with that. It’s also less pay, but that hardly matters with how few hours I get at my current job. But I dunno, I just probably need to decide by Sunday.</p>
<p>Maybe I’ll do some online shopping. I don’t really need to actually buy stuff until I get a better job, but I want to get more HomeKit stuff for when I move. I don’t want any non-HomeKit lights in my room. If whatever room I move into has non-standard bulbs like my current room does, I’m just getting more light strips/lamps and never turning them on lol. But I do like bright, warm light. I hate cool light, but I do need a lot of light to feel awake. But I think I could pull it off with enough light strips. But that’s only if I don’t end up in a room where they’ve never heard of normal light bulbs.</p>
<p>Tomorrow my desk comes. It does not come put together. That process is likely to be irritating enough that I won’t want to record it, but I’m gonna try to take some pictures along the way so I can at least post them here. And maybe on Instagram because I’m still deciding if I wanna actually use that website or not. Or&hellip; Mastodon? maybe? I need to make a whole separate post about Mastodon at some point. I wanna like it, but it also seems kinda pointless. I also signed up for the Bluesky beta, but I’ve heard it’s got moderation issues and other similar issues to Twitter. Which would be totally crazy if the Twitter clone made by the old Twitter boss had Twitter issues.</p>
<p>Speaking of social media, can we talk about how fucking dumb Redditors are? Motherfuckers just make shit up. I’ve seen two separate discussions this week about how we should’ve known Google was gonna be evil when they took “don’t be evil” out of their code of conduct. Except&hellip; that’s still there. And those words never changed the fact that they have always been a capitalist company that only exists to make money, anyway. But great observation, you dumbasses.</p>
<p>Anyway, this is just something I’m trying. I think I’ll try to make myself put something up on this site every day. Even if it’s just sort of a journal for myself to look back on later. Could be nice. I dunno.</p>

      <title>Tumblr sucks</title>

      <description>I was going to move my blog to Tumblr. I barely post anyway and it seemed like a decent idea. I customized a theme. Things were going alright. The theme looked good. It kinda worked.
Then I linked to my blog from the homepage. Then I realized when you click that link, Tumblr breaks the back button in your browser.
What year is this? Seriously!? What website is still breaking the back button in 2023?</description>

<p><em><strong>What year is this?</strong></em> Seriously!? What website is still breaking the back button in 2023? One thing is for certain, it won’t be my blog!</p>
<p>I assume it has something to do with them injecting advertising into the theme or in some other way caused by them trying to make money. All I know is, if you click the blog link on my website, and then click the back button, it should bring you back to my website, not trap you in a loop.</p>
<p>So yeah my blog lives here still because Tumblr is broken. Maybe I&rsquo;ll post something here more often. Unlikely though.</p>

      <title>Thoughts on HomeKit vs Alexa</title>
      <link>https://www.jexetic.com/posts/homekit/</link>

      <description>A while ago, I decided I wanted my lights to be smart. I wanted to be able to setup scenes and automations and control them through my phone or other devices. I bought an Echo Dot and some Govee lights. The Govee lights were great, the Echo and Alexa and that whole system&amp;hellip; not so much.
Even though I liked the Govee lights, my goal was to be able to use multiple brands and have them all under one sort of centralized hub.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A while ago, I decided I wanted my lights to be smart. I wanted to be able to setup scenes and automations and control them through my phone or other devices. I bought an Echo Dot and some Govee lights. The Govee lights were great, the Echo and Alexa and that whole system&hellip; not so much.</p>
<p>Even though I liked the Govee lights, my goal was to be able to use multiple brands and have them all under one sort of centralized hub. That was the purpose Alexa/Amazon was supposed to serve. Unfortunately, using Alexa is the opposite of convenient. The Echo app sort of offers a way to control your devices through the app itself, but it clearly expected you to just use Alexa voice commands instead. And, like I said, these voice commands just aren’t convenient. Amazon’s system just didn’t really work for me.</p>
<p>Then I started eyeing HomeKit. I use a bunch of Apple devices, so having my lights connected and easily controlled through all of them seemed like it would be great. And it is. Unfortunately Govee is not HomeKit compatible, so even though I thought their products were decent I have switched to Meross bulbs and light strips. But, having everything in HomeKit makes the smart lights actually convenient and useful. I will absolutely not claim that Siri is the best virtual assistant, but she sure is great at activating my HomeKit scenes, and she’s always available through my AirPods or Apple Watch. And if I don’t feel like using voice commands, home controls are easily available in control center. This is exactly what I was looking for.</p>
<p>Currently, there are definitely a lot less device options if you choose HomeKit over Google Home or Alexa. But my experience on HomeKit has been a lot more seamless than those platforms. It feels more like everything is connected and the options to control it are a lot more convenient. In the future I plan on buying a few Eve Buttons or something similar, because having actual physical controls in the real world is also convenient sometimes. These buttons aren’t an option if you’re using Alexa as the backend for your smart home.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I’m happy with HomeKit. This isn’t an in depth review or comparison, but just a quick recap of my experience using both Alexa and HomeKit and why I like HomeKit more. Your mileage may vary, especially if you don’t use many Apple devices. But honestly I have not found another alternative that works for me as seamlessly as HomeKit does, and I’ve tried both Alexa and Google Home in the past. They are very different types of systems in my opinion, and I would be happy to see other ecosystems rip off some features of HomeKit, mainly the ability to conveniently do things without yelling at a virtual assistant :)</p>

      <title>Tech I Like (November 2022)</title>
      <link>https://www.jexetic.com/posts/my-tech-ecosystem-november-2022/</link>

      <description>For the past few months I’ve been working on diversifying my tech ecosystem a bit. I have used Google for almost everything in the past but thinking about what could happen if I lost access to my Google account for whatever reason made me decide maybe it wasn’t such a good idea to rely on one company for basically all my technology needs. So, here’s what I’ve been using.
Email, Contacts, and Calendar I switched from Gmail to Fastmail for all of my email addresses.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the past few months I’ve been working on diversifying my tech ecosystem a bit. I have used Google for almost everything in the past but thinking about what could happen if I lost access to my Google account for whatever reason made me decide maybe it wasn’t such a good idea to rely on one company for basically all my technology needs. So, here’s what I’ve been using.</p>
<h2 id="email-contacts-and-calendar">Email, Contacts, and Calendar</h2>
<p>I switched from Gmail to Fastmail for all of my email addresses. I used to forward my custom domain emails into Gmail and then use SendGrid to send emails, but SendGrid’s free plan and the whole solution overall just seemed a little janky. Fastmail is $5 a month. I know for a lot of people, paying for email is a no-go. But it’s nice to not rely on Google for something as important as my email (and, by extension, basically all of my online accounts). I picked Fastmail over Proton because it supports as many custom domains as I would like and just felt a little more open/neutral and has better vibes to me.</p>
<h2 id="photos-and-cloud-storage">Photos and Cloud Storage</h2>
<p>For photos and file storage, I’m sticking with Google. I setup a fresh Google account that uses my custom domain email instead of a Gmail address and started a subscription for 100GB of storage. Google Photos is too good to move away from, and Google Drive is pretty perfect as well. I plan on using Google Takeout regularly and keeping local backups for everything in addition to keeping it in the cloud. If I lose access to the account, I should still have all the data (because of regular backups) and can bring it elsewhere.</p>
<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<p>I am trying out a new notes app called UpNote and so far I love it. It seems like the perfect system for me. The organization is super flexible. The apps seem quick and lightweight. It’s available on all platforms. Plus, I purchased a lifetime license, so I should never have to worry about a subscription cost. (At the time of posting this I have been using it for quite a bit of time and have no plans of switching - it does everything I need)</p>
<h2 id="task-management">Task Management</h2>
<p>I have been heavily using Todoist each day to manage my to-do list. I have looked at Things 3 a lot but I really can’t figure out a workflow in it that works for me. I rely on the app pretty heavily because I have a terrible memory. It’s a nice little productivity hub for me. I’ve tried a lot of other options besides Todoist and Things 3 as well, and I think the price of Todoist is worth it because it’s the only one that feels natural to me.</p>
<h2 id="domains--hosting">Domains &amp; Hosting</h2>
<p>I settled on Porkbun for my domains. I’m using Github Pages to host this blog and I have a YOURLS instance running on Hostinger for Jexetic.me. Hostinger seems fine, I don’t have much to say about it other than it hasn’t given me any problems for what limited use I have for it.</p>
<h2 id="security">Security</h2>
<p>For my password manager I am using Bitwarden. Currently I use the free plan but I’ve considered using the paid plan since it’s so cheap. I’m not sure that it’s necessary to upgrade yet, though. For 2FA I am using Authy. I personally don’t think it is a great idea to use Bitwarden for my 2FA, because it seems like that kind of defeats the whole purpose. The Authy Mac app was getting on my nerves, but I downloaded the App Store version and it seems pretty good.</p>
