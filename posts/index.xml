      <description>3 months ago I signed up for a trial of Uber One so I could bypass the delivery fee on my food delivery. That was my first mistake. Should’ve just gone and got some food for myself. But here we are today, 3 months later. I get charged $9.99 for Uber One. Damn, that sucks, but really it’s my fault for not cancelling it before I renew. But I should definitely go ahead and cancel it so it doesn’t charge me again next month, right?</description>

</a></p>
<p>The image above shows an Uber help page that states you must cancel your membership within 48 hours of it renewing. Not sooner. There’s no cancel button if you’re not within that window.  I probably don’t need to point out the obvious here, but Uber is absolutely hoping you’ll be uninterested in talking to their outsourced support and instead forget about it until they make another $10 from you. Come on, Uber. That’s so incredibly shady. </p>
<p>Now, to the support agent’s credit, he cancelled my membership and only had to be asked a total of three times. Not too terrible! But what the fuck, Uber?</p>

      <title>Diary of a Caffeine Addict</title>

      <description>My G Fuel is coming today (you can make fun of me if you want, but I’m addicted to the caffeine). I didn’t have any yesterday and ended up with a wicked headache, so that was fun. I couldn’t start my day with caffeine today, so I’ve been passing the time by editing video. I made my YouTube short that’ll go up today and one to go up tomorrow. Tomorrow’s is better.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My G Fuel is coming today (you can make fun of me if you want, but I’m addicted to the caffeine). I didn’t have any yesterday and ended up with a wicked headache, so that was fun. I couldn’t start my day with caffeine today, so I’ve been passing the time by editing video. I made my YouTube short that’ll go up today and one to go up tomorrow. Tomorrow’s is better. Today’s is good too, it’s just only eight seconds which might be a lil too short. Hopefully, the algorithm likes them.</p>
<p>Other than editing, I sent my job the official documents they needed. I’ve got another job doing a background check on me. I’m not sure if I want the new job or not. I definitely need a different job than I’ve got currently because I need more money, but the one I’m being offered would be a really long bus ride, and I’m not totally vibing with that. It’s also less pay, but that hardly matters with how few hours I get at my current job. But I dunno, I just probably need to decide by Sunday.</p>
<p>Maybe I’ll do some online shopping. I don’t really need to actually buy stuff until I get a better job, but I want to get more HomeKit stuff for when I move. I don’t want any non-HomeKit lights in my room. If whatever room I move into has non-standard bulbs like my current room does, I’m just getting more light strips/lamps and never turning them on lol. But I do like bright, warm light. I hate cool light, but I do need a lot of light to feel awake. But I think I could pull it off with enough light strips. But that’s only if I don’t end up in a room where they’ve never heard of normal light bulbs.</p>
<p>Tomorrow my desk comes. It does not come put together. That process is likely to be irritating enough that I won’t want to record it, but I’m gonna try to take some pictures along the way so I can at least post them here. And maybe on Instagram because I’m still deciding if I wanna actually use that website or not. Or&hellip; Mastodon? maybe? I need to make a whole separate post about Mastodon at some point. I wanna like it, but it also seems kinda pointless. I also signed up for the Bluesky beta, but I’ve heard it’s got moderation issues and other similar issues to Twitter. Which would be totally crazy if the Twitter clone made by the old Twitter boss had Twitter issues.</p>
<p>Speaking of social media, can we talk about how fucking dumb Redditors are? Motherfuckers just make shit up. I’ve seen two separate discussions this week about how we should’ve known Google was gonna be evil when they took “don’t be evil” out of their code of conduct. Except&hellip; that’s still there. And those words never changed the fact that they have always been a capitalist company that only exists to make money, anyway. But great observation, you dumbasses.</p>
<p>Anyway, this is just something I’m trying. I think I’ll try to make myself put something up on this site every day. Even if it’s just sort of a journal for myself to look back on later. Could be nice. I dunno.</p>

      <title>Tumblr is stupid</title>

      <description>I was going to move my blog to Tumblr. I barely post anyway and it seemed like a decent idea. I customized a theme. Things were going alright. The theme looked good. It kinda worked.
Then I linked to my blog from the homepage. Then I realized when you click that link, Tumblr breaks the back button in your browser.
WHAT FUCKING YEAR IS THIS?? Seriously!? What website is still breaking the back button in 2023?</description>

<p><em><strong>WHAT FUCKING YEAR IS THIS??</strong></em> Seriously!? What website is still breaking the back button in 2023? One thing is for certain, it won’t be my blog!</p>
<p>I assume it has something to do with them injecting advertising into the theme or in some other way caused by them trying to make money. All I know is, if you click the blog link on my website, and then click the back button, it should bring you back to my website, not trap you in a loop.</p>
<p>So yeah my blog lives here still because Tumblr is broken. Maybe I&rsquo;ll post something here more often. Unlikely though.</p>

      <title>Hey Google, Stop Screwing With My Metadata!</title>
      <link>https://www.jexetic.com/posts/google-photos-metadata/</link>

      <description>I like Google Photos. I’ve considered other options, like Dropbox, but the thing that keeps me paying for Google One storage is how nicely Google Photos take all the photos I throw at it and organizes them for me. I don’t have to worry about manually tagging photos or making albums. If I wanna go back and look my photos later, they’re already neatly arranged for me. I choose to backup everything in original quality, because of course I want to be able to go back later and get that photo or video in original resolution if I need or want it.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I like Google Photos. I’ve considered other options, like Dropbox, but the thing that keeps me paying for Google One storage is how nicely Google Photos take all the photos I throw at it and organizes them for me. I don’t have to worry about manually tagging photos or making albums. If I wanna go back and look my photos later, they’re already neatly arranged for me. </p>
<p>I choose to backup everything in original quality, because of course I want to be able to go back later and get that photo or video in original resolution if I need or want it. As a side-note, this is why I wasn’t really bothered when they discontinued free unlimited uploads; I want my backup in full quality anyway. I also very much like to be able to grab <em>all</em> of my photos &amp; videos at once, in full quality, so I can keep them backed up and not rely solely on Google. Luckily, Google Takeout makes this really easy. Well, almost&hellip;</p>
<p>You see, Google Takeout <em>does</em> export all your photos and videos in full quality for you. It even exports the metadata for you, like the creation date and location. The problem is, is exports that data <em>separately!</em> What?! Why is the date my photo was taken stored in some random JSON file instead of, you know, in file itself like it should be? The only obvious reason I can guess is to keep you from easily moving your entire library to another competing service. But they’re my photos. If I want to move them, I will. What the hell, Google? Why are you stripping my photos of their metadata and then giving it back to me in a different file? Why??</p>
<p>Luckily, there is a program that exists to fix this issue. Aptly named “Google Photos Metadata Fixer,” it does just that. You upload your Google Photos Takeout zip, and it combines the metadata back into the photos themselves. You know, the way Google should give it to you in the first place. I didn’t really mind paying for the program. It works great. My only worry is that eventually, Google will decide to stop giving me the metadata altogether, or make it harder to export my library in a new way. I take regular Takeout backups rather than relying solely on Google to store anything, and it’s because they do things like this that make me question whether my data is truly safe with them. It’s a shame, because I truly can’t bring myself to switch to any competitor because of how good Google Photos is otherwise.</p>

      <title>Thoughts on HomeKit vs Alexa</title>
      <link>https://www.jexetic.com/posts/homekit/</link>

      <description>A while ago, I decided I wanted my lights to be smart. I wanted to be able to setup scenes and automations and control them through my phone or other devices. I bought an Echo Dot and some Govee lights. The Govee lights were great, the Echo and Alexa and that whole system&amp;hellip; not so much.
Even though I liked the Govee lights, my goal was to be able to use multiple brands and have them all under one sort of centralized hub.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A while ago, I decided I wanted my lights to be smart. I wanted to be able to setup scenes and automations and control them through my phone or other devices. I bought an Echo Dot and some Govee lights. The Govee lights were great, the Echo and Alexa and that whole system&hellip; not so much.</p>
<p>Even though I liked the Govee lights, my goal was to be able to use multiple brands and have them all under one sort of centralized hub. That was the purpose Alexa/Amazon was supposed to serve. Unfortunately, using Alexa is the opposite of convenient. The Echo app sort of offers a way to control your devices through the app itself, but it clearly expected you to just use Alexa voice commands instead. And, like I said, these voice commands just aren’t convenient. Amazon’s system just didn’t really work for me.</p>
<p>Then I started eyeing HomeKit. I use a bunch of Apple devices, so having my lights connected and easily controlled through all of them seemed like it would be great. And it is. Unfortunately Govee is not HomeKit compatible, so even though I thought their products were decent I have switched to Meross bulbs and light strips. But, having everything in HomeKit makes the smart lights actually convenient and useful. I will absolutely not claim that Siri is the best virtual assistant, but she sure is great at activating my HomeKit scenes, and she’s always available through my AirPods or Apple Watch. And if I don’t feel like using voice commands, home controls are easily available in control center. This is exactly what I was looking for.</p>
<p>Currently, there are definitely a lot less device options if you choose HomeKit over Google Home or Alexa. But my experience on HomeKit has been a lot more seamless than those platforms. It feels more like everything is connected and the options to control it are a lot more convenient. In the future I plan on buying a few Eve Buttons or something similar, because having actual physical controls in the real world is also convenient sometimes. These buttons aren’t an option if you’re using Alexa as the backend for your smart home.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I’m happy with HomeKit. This isn’t an in depth review or comparison, but just a quick recap of my experience using both Alexa and HomeKit and why I like HomeKit more. Your mileage may vary, especially if you don’t use many Apple devices. But honestly I have not found another alternative that works for me as seamlessly as HomeKit does, and I’ve tried both Alexa and Google Home in the past. They are very different types of systems in my opinion, and I would be happy to see other ecosystems rip off some features of HomeKit, mainly the ability to conveniently do things without yelling at a virtual assistant :)</p>

      <title>My Tech Ecosystem (November 2022)</title>
      <link>https://www.jexetic.com/posts/my-tech-ecosystem-november-2022/</link>

      <description>For the past few months I’ve been working on diversifying my tech ecosystem a bit. I have used Google for almost everything in the past but thinking about what could happen if I lost access to my Google account for whatever reason made me decide maybe it wasn’t such a good idea to rely on one company for basically all my technology needs. So, here’s what I’ve been using.
Email, Contacts, and Calendar I switched from Gmail to Fastmail for all of my email addresses.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the past few months I’ve been working on diversifying my tech ecosystem a bit. I have used Google for almost everything in the past but thinking about what could happen if I lost access to my Google account for whatever reason made me decide maybe it wasn’t such a good idea to rely on one company for basically all my technology needs. So, here’s what I’ve been using.</p>
<h2 id="email-contacts-and-calendar">Email, Contacts, and Calendar</h2>
<p>I switched from Gmail to Fastmail for all of my email addresses. I used to forward my custom domain emails into Gmail and then use SendGrid to send emails, but SendGrid’s free plan and the whole solution overall just seemed a little janky. Fastmail is $5 a month. I know for a lot of people, paying for email is a no-go. But it’s nice to not rely on Google for something as important as my email (and, by extension, basically all of my online accounts). I picked Fastmail over Proton because it supports as many custom domains as I would like and just felt a little more open/neutral and has better vibes to me.</p>
<h2 id="photos-and-cloud-storage">Photos and Cloud Storage</h2>
<p>For photos and file storage, I’m sticking with Google. I setup a fresh Google account that uses my custom domain email instead of a Gmail address and started a subscription for 100GB of storage. Google Photos is too good to move away from, and Google Drive is pretty perfect as well. I plan on using Google Takeout regularly and keeping local backups for everything in addition to keeping it in the cloud. If I lose access to the account, I should still have all the data (because of regular backups) and can bring it elsewhere.</p>
<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<p>I am trying out a new notes app called UpNote and so far I love it. It seems like the perfect system for me. The organization is super flexible. The apps seem quick and lightweight. It’s available on all platforms. Plus, I purchased a lifetime license, so I should never have to worry about a subscription cost. (At the time of posting this I have been using it for quite a bit of time and have no plans of switching - it does everything I need)</p>
<h2 id="task-management">Task Management</h2>
<p>I have been heavily using Todoist each day to manage my to-do list. I have looked at Things 3 a lot but I really can’t figure out a workflow in it that works for me. I rely on the app pretty heavily because I have a terrible memory. It’s a nice little productivity hub for me. I’ve tried a lot of other options besides Todoist and Things 3 as well, and I think the price of Todoist is worth it because it’s the only one that feels natural to me.</p>
<h2 id="domains--hosting">Domains &amp; Hosting</h2>
<p>I settled on Porkbun for my domains. I’m using Github Pages to host this blog and I have a YOURLS instance running on Hostinger for Jexetic.me. Hostinger seems fine, I don’t have much to say about it other than it hasn’t given me any problems for what limited use I have for it.</p>
<h2 id="security">Security</h2>
<p>For my password manager I am using Bitwarden. Currently I use the free plan but I’ve considered using the paid plan since it’s so cheap. I’m not sure that it’s necessary to upgrade yet, though. For 2FA I am using Authy. I personally don’t think it is a great idea to use Bitwarden for my 2FA, because it seems like that kind of defeats the whole purpose. The Authy Mac app was getting on my nerves, but I downloaded the App Store version and it seems pretty good.</p>

      <title>Medal is Ruined</title>

      <description>There’s this app called Medal that I have somewhat liked for a while. Basically, it’s an app to capture and trim gaming moments with a hotkey so you can share them in Discord or whatever. I actually generally just used OBS to do the actual recording, so what Medal was good for in my scenario was trimming down those replay clips and providing an easy place to host them so I could share them into a Discord server.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There’s this app called Medal that I have somewhat liked for a while. Basically, it’s an app to capture and trim gaming moments with a hotkey so you can share them in Discord or whatever. I actually generally just used OBS to do the actual recording, so what Medal was good for in my scenario was trimming down those replay clips and providing an easy place to host them so I could share them into a Discord server. Unfortunately, that functionality is essentially gone. Yes, you can still use Medal to share clips to Discord. But they’ve completely disabled embeds. Let’s be real: nobody wants to open their web browser just to watch a 15-30 second gaming clip. Removing Discord embeds immediately makes the app less useful. Unfortunately, it doesn’t even end there. Medal now also wants to charge you to download the clips you’re hosting there if you don’t want them to add a watermark. This just plain sucks, to be honest. This means it’s hardly useful as a place to actually store/host clips anymore. If I’m gonna pay for somewhere to host the clips I may as well just pay for something like Streamable and get 2TB for whatever video uploads I want, and they’ll actually embed to Discord. Or, you know, just throw them on YouTube for free. Which also embeds to Discord. C’mon Medal, you know what we’re using your app for. You ruined it. RIP.</p>
<p>Update: They have added back the ability to embed to Discord, although it&rsquo;s now controlled by a setting which seems to be disabled by default which is just odd. You do still need to pay if you&rsquo;d like to be able to download your clips without a Medal watermark.</p>
