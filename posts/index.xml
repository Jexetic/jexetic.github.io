      <description>My G Fuel is coming today (you can make fun of me if you want, but I’m addicted to the caffeine). I didn’t have any yesterday and ended up with a wicked headache, so that was fun. I couldn’t start my day with caffeine today, so I’ve been passing the time by editing video. I made my YouTube short that’ll go up today and one to go up tomorrow. Tomorrow’s is better.</description>

      <description>I was going to move my blog to Tumblr. I barely post anyway and it seemed like a decent idea. I customized a theme. Things were going alright. The theme looked good. It kinda worked.
Then I linked to my blog from the homepage. Then I realized when you click that link, Tumblr breaks the back button in your browser.
WHAT FUCKING YEAR IS THIS?? Seriously!? What website is still breaking the back button in 2023?</description>

      <description>I like Google Photos. I’ve considered other options, like Dropbox, but the thing that keeps me paying for Google One storage is how nicely Google Photos take all the photos I throw at it and organizes them for me. I don’t have to worry about manually tagging photos or making albums. If I wanna go back and look my photos later, they’re already neatly arranged for me. I choose to backup everything in original quality, because of course I want to be able to go back later and get that photo or video in original resolution if I need or want it.</description>

      <title>Thoughts on HomeKit vs Alexa</title>

      <description>A while ago, I decided I wanted my lights to be smart. I wanted to be able to setup scenes and automations and control them through my phone or other devices. I bought an Echo Dot and some Govee lights. The Govee lights were great, the Echo and Alexa and that whole system&amp;hellip; not so much.
Even though I liked the Govee lights, my goal was to be able to use multiple brands and have them all under one sort of centralized hub.</description>

      <title>My Tech Ecosystem (November 2022)</title>

      <description>For the past few months I’ve been working on diversifying my tech ecosystem a bit. I have used Google for almost everything in the past but thinking about what could happen if I lost access to my Google account for whatever reason made me decide maybe it wasn’t such a good idea to rely on one company for basically all my technology needs. So, here’s what I’ve been using.
Email, Contacts, and Calendar I switched from Gmail to Fastmail for all of my email addresses.</description>

      <title>Medal is Ruined</title>

      <description>There’s this app called Medal that I have somewhat liked for a while. Basically, it’s an app to capture and trim gaming moments with a hotkey so you can share them in Discord or whatever. I actually generally just used OBS to do the actual recording, so what Medal was good for in my scenario was trimming down those replay clips and providing an easy place to host them so I could share them into a Discord server.</description>
